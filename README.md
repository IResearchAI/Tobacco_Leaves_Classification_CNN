# Tobacco_Leaves_Classification_System 
At  present,  manual  processing  is  done  for tobacco  leaves harvestingand segregation. Real time detection and classification oftobaccoleaves is one of the biggest challenges in tobacco cultivation.Fast and accurate classifica-tion  system  of  uncured  tobacco  leaves,  helps  farmers  during  curing  process  with less computational resources. In this paper, a fast reliable and accurate pipeline for real time tobacco leaves classification using deep neural networks is presented. In the  proposed  work,  we  have  used  our  own  captured  Indian  soil  produced  tobacco leaves  image  data  set  and  classified  into  several  classes  based  on  the  curing  pro-cess. The model is trained and compared using various deep learning architectures based  on  their  top-1  and  top-5  accuracy.  The  proposed  model  is  trained  with  720 green  tobacco  leaves,  which  achieved  92%  of  top-1  accuracy  after  implementing various data augmentation techniques. In the last decade, deep learning approaches has been widely used in many applications like Image processing, Text summariza-tion, Image and video analysis, Image classification, object detection and tracking, scene  labeling  etc.Many  models  like  Auto  encoders,sparsedecoders,  Recurrent Neural Networks and ConvolutionalNeural Networks are became commonly used approaches  in  Deep  learning.  CNN  is  one  of  the  best  performance  models  and  is used extensively for image classification purposes. One of the major characteristics of  CNN  is  its  self  extracting  feature  property  which  hugely  helps  in  segmentation and classification problems. Inour proposed system, wecompare some of the well knownpre-defined CNN architectures such as ImageNet,  GoogleLeNet, VGGNet, AlexNet, Inception V3 and V4, ResNet, DenseNet, ConveNet etc trained and tested on our dataset. The best performing model is further run on the Raspberry Pi 3 for real time classification
